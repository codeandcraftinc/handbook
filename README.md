# Workflows

This is a living document of common practices for
[_smooth operation_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYv2PhG89A) day-to-day.
I think we should encourage conversation around this document -- what works,
what doesn't, and how we can change for the better. The items below will be
written in a pseudo-RFC format, utilizing the keywords listed in the IETF's
[RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).



## Tools

The services below provide really solid baseline support for operating a
business. They also provide really wonderful APIs, so if there's a feature
that's missing or that could improve our workflow **we can totally build it**.

- [**Harvest**](https://www.getharvest.com/), time tracking and cost analysis
- [**Tracker**](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/), project management and
  planning (review the philosophy behind this tool
  [here](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/gettingstarted))
- [**Google Apps**](https://apps.google.com/), email, calendar, file store
- [**GitHub**](https://www.github.com/), codebases and other versioned
  resources
- [**Slack**](https://www.slack.com/), team chat

##### Meetings

These can get unweildy quickly, and we've all got limited space in our heads,
so let's keep them as simple and understandable as possible. When you need to
add a calendar event you **SHOULD** follow these steps:

- prefix the event with the client code e.g. `[JAKO]` or `[COG]` -- this makes
  it easy to see what the meeting is about at a glace. Use `[CC]` for Code &
  Craft
- include the purpose of the meeting in the description
- include links to relevant items in our PM tool
- add the event to _Code & Craft_ Google calendar so it's visible to everyone

- invite everyone (including yourself) that needs to be involved
- allow guests to modify the meeting so anyone can keep it updated

> **Note:** many suggest keeping meetings to [15 minutes or less](https://open.bufferapp.com/how-to-hold-a-better-meeting-research/),
> so unless it's a whiteboarding session (or something similar) try to stick
> to a timeline.
