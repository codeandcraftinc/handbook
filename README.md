# Workflows

This is a living document of common practices for
[_smooth operation_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYv2PhG89A) day-to-day.
I think we should encourage conversation around this document -- what works,
what doesn't, and how we can change for the better. The items below will be
written in a pseudo-RFC format, utilizing the keywords listed in the IETF's
[RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).



## Tools

The services below provide really solid baseline support for operating a
business. They also provide really wonderful APIs, so if there's a feature
that's missing or that could improve our workflow **we can totally build it**.

- [**Harvest**](https://www.getharvest.com/), time tracking and cost analysis
- [**Tracker**](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/), project management and
  planning (review the philosophy behind this tool
  [here](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/gettingstarted))
- [**Google Apps**](https://apps.google.com/), email, calendar, file store
- [**GitHub**](https://www.github.com/), codebases and other versioned
  resources
